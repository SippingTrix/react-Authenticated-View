# react-Authenticated-View


Authenticated View Component
Your goal in this warmup exercise to build and implement a Higher Order Component that wraps around "authenticated content". You can add this to an existing project, or create a new project from scratch.

Your Application should meet the following requirements:
Your project should have a "login" form (for the sake of the exercise, this doesn't have to be a legitimate login with credential validation) and your AuthenticatedView component at the top level of the application
All other application content should be wrapped in the AuthenticatedView component.
The AuthenticatedView component should only display the rest of the application content if the user has logged in.
While not logged in, the AuthenticatedView component should render a message to the user, saying "Please log in to view this content"
-(Stretch) make use of localStorage to persist a logged in user when refreshing or closing/opening the application
